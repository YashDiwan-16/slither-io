```typescript
// Real blockchain transaction implementation
async claimReward(rewardId: string, playerWallet: PublicKey, connection: Connection)
```
- Manages reward calculations and blockchain transactions
- Uses Solana's SystemProgram for token transfers
- Implements proper transaction signing and confirmation

#### **Enhanced Death Screen** (`src/components/EnhancedDeathScreen.tsx`)
- Beautiful animated UI with rank-based themes
- Performance statistics with animated progress bars
- Integrated reward claiming system

#### **Reward Pool Status** (`src/components/RewardPoolStatus.tsx`)

- Rarity-based visual design

### Blockchain Integration

```typescript
// Environment Variables Required
VITE_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://rpc.gorbagana.wtf
VITE_VAULT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
VITE_ENTRY_FEE=0.01
VITE_HOUSE_EDGE=5
```

### Transaction Flow
1. **Entry Fee Collection**: Players pay 0.01 GOR to join game
2. **Pool Accumulation**: 95% goes to reward pool, 5% house edge
3. **Game Completion**: Rewards calculated based on performance
4. **Claim Process**: Real blockchain transfer from vault to player
5. **Confirmation**: Transaction verified and confirmed on-chain

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Death Screen Features

- **Others**: Green gradient with target theme

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your vault private key
VITE_VAULT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install bs58 @types/bs58
```

### 3. Generate Vault Keypair
```javascript
// Use this to generate a new keypair for testing
import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
import bs58 from 'bs58';

const keypair = Keypair.generate();
const privateKey = bs58.encode(keypair.secretKey);
console.log('Private Key:', privateKey);
console.log('Public Key:', keypair.publicKey.toBase58());
```

## 📊 Reward Calculation Example

For a game with 10 players and 0.095 GOR pool (after house edge):
- **Winner (Rank 1)**: ~0.038 GOR base + 0.005 winner bonus = 0.043+ GOR
- **Runner-up (Rank 2-3)**: ~0.014 GOR base + performance bonuses
- **Top 10 (Rank 4-10)**: ~0.003 GOR base + performance bonuses
- **Others**: Participation rewards if score > threshold
